### :writing_hand: Web phishing detection:
There are a number of users who purchase products online and make payments through e-banking. 

There are e-banking websites that ask users to provide sensitive data such as username, password & credit card details, etc., often for malicious reasons. 

This type of e-banking website is known as a phishing website. 

In order to detect and predict e-banking phishing websites, we proposed an intelligent, flexible and effective system that is based on classification algorithms. 

Once a user enters a URL in our website, our system will use a machine learning algorithm to detect whether the entered URL is a phishing URL or not.

## :thumbsup:***Now it's easy to find a phishing website***:clap:
